My name is Huy Hoang. I like to write code, build software, and learn about Computer stuffs. I also dabble in football (not the American one), photography, and cooking.
I created this blog to share and help myself learn about various topics: Programming, Concurrency, Distributed Systems etc.

I am currently a Software Enginneer at AWS.
